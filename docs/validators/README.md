# Run a Validator Node (Testnet)

> [!CAUTION]
> Running a validator node is a complex process and requires a lot of technical knowledge. We're not kidding here!

Run a full node as described [here](../../README.md) and allow it to **fully sync**, then follow the instructions below to run a validator node.

**Once again, allow the node to fully sync! You should see the "New block" log with the latest block on the [explorer](https://explorer.x1-testnet.xen.network/).**

1. Fund your validator wallet with enough XN to become a validator. At the time of writing, you need at least 100,000 XN to become a validator.
   **We highly recommend using a hardware wallet.**

2. Create a new validator key.

   To create a validator private key to sign consensus messages, use go-x1.
   Take note of the validator public key; we will need it later.

   > Create validator key
    ```shell
    x1 validator new
    ```

   After entering the command, you will be prompted to enter a passwordâ€”use a strong one!
   You can, for example, use a password manager to generate a strong password to secure your wallet.

3. Place the validator password in a file.

    ```shell
    echo "MY_STRONG_PASSWORD" > ~/.x1/.password
    ```

4. Navigate to the [SFC Contract](https://explorer.x1-testnet.xen.network/address/0xFC00FACE00000000000000000000000000000000/write-contract#address-tabs) on the explorer.

5. Click the "Connect wallet" button and connect to your validator wallet.

6. Enter your validator public key and the amount of XN you want to stake, then click "Write".

7. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

8. Verify that your validator is registered by looking up your validator ID on the [PWA explorer](https://pwa-explorer.x1-testnet.xen.network/staking).

9. Stop your node, add the `--validator.id` and `--validator.pubkey` flags to your node's command line, and restart your node.

   Replace `VALIDATOR_ID` with your validator ID and `VALIDATOR_PUBKEY` with your validator's public key.

    ```shell
    x1 --testnet --validator.id VALIDATOR_ID --validator.pubkey VALIDATOR_PUBKEY --validator.password ~/.x1/.password
    ```

   Congratulations, you are now running an X1 validator node! Make sure to keep your node up and running 24 hours a day.
